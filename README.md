# Nova Builders & Developers

A luxury real estate portfolio concept with a scroll-driven construction film, animated architectural blueprint, interactive 3D tower, filterable project collection, and accessible project details.

## Local preview

Use Node.js 20 or later. No dependencies need to be installed.

```powershell
cd nova-builders
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4173/. The preview is local only and supports MP4 byte ranges for video scrubbing.

```powershell
npm run check
```

The website source is in `nova-builders/dist/`. GSAP, Lenis, Three.js, and Google Fonts load from their existing CDNs. If those services are unavailable, the page remains readable and the 3D stage displays a concept image.

All company details, project names, specifications, and imagery are fictional portfolio content. The consultation form prepares a copyable enquiry draft locally; it does not send messages or store information.

### Interactions

- Scroll through the hero to scrub the construction film.
- Filter the collection and select a project to open its details.
- Drag the tower, use the arrow keys, pause rotation, reset the view, or switch to wireframe.
- Prepare a consultation draft with the selected project already filled in.
- Reduced motion uses a static hero and pauses the tower’s automatic rotation.

No public hosting or deployment is configured.
